# **Doggo Mod Overhauled**
Doggo Mod Overhauled is a mod that just makes dogs better by adding personality, dog bowls for dogs to eat from and a little tennis ball to play fetch.  
It is a complete rewrite of the mod [Doggo Mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/doggo-mod "Doggo Mod") and fixes various bugs such as Multiplayer compatibility.

## **Blocks and items**
This mod adds:
- 172 different dog beds (16 colors * 11 wood types)
- 16 differently colored dog bowls
- 4 differently colored tennis balls

### <ins>Dog Bed</ins>
For now this is just a decoration block. Functionality will be added some time in the future.

### <ins>Dog Bowl</ins>
Any dog with low health if close enough will eat from it if there is food inside it.

You can also rename a dog bowl in an anvil to give it a name.  
Only dogs with matching names will eat from it.

To break it, you need at least a stone pickaxe.

### <ins>Tennis Ball</ins>
A small toy for your dog to play with.  
You can throw it by right-clicking it. (Though be careful when you're near glass panes)

## **Behavior and personality**
### <ins>Healing</ins>
There are two ways to heal a dog:  
1. Place down a dog bowl and put food (preferably meat) in it by right-clicking on the dog bowl. If a dog is near a dog bowl and it's not on max health, it will try eating from it.  
2. You can give food (preferably meat) to a dog by right-clicking on it. The dog will then hold it in its mouth and eat whenever it wants to.

### Holding an item
A dog can hold an item in its mouth at any time. Dogs prefer food over weapons in case you want your dog to become a warrior.

### <ins>Napping</ins>
If you leave a dog sitting and walk a way, it will lay down and take a nap.

### <ins>Playing fetch</ins>
Just throwing the ball won't make a dog run after it.  
To actually play fetch, you have to:
1. Show the ball to the dog to make it interested.
2. Once it's interested in the ball then you can throw it.

### <ins>Scratching its ear</ins>
From time to time a dog may scratch its ear.

### <ins>Sniffing</ins>
From time to time a dog may start sniffing the ground.

If it thinks it has found something, it will start digging for it. Who knows what treasure lies beneath. Though asking for diamonds or netherite might be too much.

### <ins>Stretching</ins>
From time to time a dog may stretch.
