## **Behavior and personality**
### <ins>Healing</ins>
There are two ways to heal a dog:  
1. Place down a dog bowl and put food (preferably meat) in it by right-clicking on the dog bowl. If a dog is near a dog bowl and it's not on max health, it will try eating from it.  
2. You can give food (preferably meat) to a dog by right-clicking on it. The dog will then hold it in its mouth and eat whenever it wants to.

### Holding an item
A dog can hold an item in its mouth at any time. Dogs prefer food over weapons in case you want your dog to become a warrior.

If you leave a dog sitting and walk a way, it will lay down and take a nap.

### <ins>Playing fetch</ins>
Just throwing the ball won't make a dog run after it.  
To actually play fetch, you have to:
1. Show the ball to the dog to make it interested.
2. Once it's interested in the ball then you can throw it.

If it thinks it has found something, it will start digging for it. Who knows what treasure lies beneath. Though asking for diamonds or netherite might be too much.

## **Summary**
Doggo Mod Overhauled is a fantastic mod that improves the personality and behavior of dogs in Minecraft. The mod adds a lot of exciting features, such as dog bowls for feeding and a tennis ball for playing fetch. If a dog is low on health, it will automatically eat from a dog bowl if there is food in it. The dog bowl can be renamed in an anvil, and only dogs with matching names will eat from it.
One of the significant features of the mod is the ability to heal your dog. You can either place down a dog bowl with food or give food directly to your dog to hold in its mouth and eat whenever it wants. Additionally, dogs can hold items in their mouths, but they prefer food over weapons.
The mod also introduces various new behaviors for dogs. They can take a nap when left alone, scratch their ears, and sniff the ground. If a dog finds something of interest while sniffing, it will start digging for it, making it an exciting way to discover hidden treasures.
The tennis ball feature is another exciting addition to the mod. Dogs can play fetch with the ball, but you must first show it to them to make them interested. Once interested, you can throw it, and the dog will happily retrieve it for you.
Overall, Doggo Mod Overhauled is an excellent mod that adds more personality and fun to Minecraft's furry friends. It's a must-try for all dog lovers out there.
